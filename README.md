## Project Description
This website is the final milestone project of the Code Institute Full Stack Web Development Program. The main Technologies used for the site are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python and Django.

My final project is an online store that sells training clothing and protein belonging to the MMA Cork gym. The purpose of the site is to allow members to view different products, add these products to their basket and securely purchase their order. 

The user is also able to create an account on the website and view the MMA Cork Blog posts.

It is important to add that this site is not a fully functioning e-commerce store and is solely for educational purchases. You can use the following information below to simulate a card purchase on the store

* Card Number - 4242 4242 4242 4242
* Expiry Date - Any date.
* CVV - Any 3-digit number.

### Wireframes 
I used Balsamiq wireframes create a basic visual of how the main pages of the site would look on desktop  and mobile devices.

You can view the wireframes below.

* [Landing Page](media/landing-page.png)
* [Products Page](media/products-page.png)
* [Product Details](media/product-details.png)
* [Shopping Bag](media/bag.png)
* [Secure Checkout](media/secure-checkout.png)
* [Blog](media/blog.png)
* [Blog Details](media/blog-details.png)

It is important to note that I did not do a wireframe for certain pages as a result of the deadline date for this project.
